  only the return-status 1, 7 and 13 (and maybe 2) are relevant for the detection and identification of hardware-failures
  the other statuses are good to know if you want to double-check a certain hw-failure-detection, but they
  are not used in this version of the algorithm (maybe i can use the on the second board in an other algorithm)
  
  return-status 2, 5 and 11 are rekevant for the evaluation of the pressed-status of the switch-button.

  Note/TODO: Maybe it is better / nicer to use a map in this function, to map a voltage to an interval, that can be mapped to a status!
